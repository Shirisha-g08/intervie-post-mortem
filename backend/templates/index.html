        <!-- For MVP, we link to the frontend dev server or build output. 
             Since the user asked for a simple HTML landing page served by FastAPI, 
             we might link to the react app URL if they are running separately, 
             OR if we were serving the React app build from FastAPI, we'd link there.
             
             However, the user wants "A button that links to the analysis page". 
             If the "analysis page" is the React app, we should link to that URL.
             If they want a simple HTML form served by FastAPI (server-side rendered), 
             we would create another template.
             
             Given the previous steps built a React frontend, I'll assume they want to link to the React App URL.
             Let's assume the React app runs on port 5173 for dev, or 
             maybe the user intends to replace the React app with this simple page?
             
             Re-reading: "The backend is running successfully... add a root route... serve a simple HTML landing page"
             "Add a button that links to the analysis page"
             
             I will make the button link to http://localhost:5173 for now, 
             or I can add a simple JS redirect script if they want it served from the same origin eventually.
             Let's just use a relative link `/analysis` if we are serving the react app from here, 
             but we are NOT serving the react app from FastAPI yet (Create React App/Vite is separate).
             
             To be safe and helpful, I will link to the React App's URL (http://localhost:5173) 
             since that's where the "Analysis Page" (the React component) lives right now.
